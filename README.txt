This program generates a series of numbers (positive integers), with a hidden set of
keys (negative numbers -1 to -60) placed randomly throuhgout the file

The program finds these keys for the user using two different tehcniques of forking, with 
DFS and BFS implementation.

Before testing the function, make sure to make all the files executable.
Next you want to run "./populate" first to create the list of numbers
Then you can run "./part1"
